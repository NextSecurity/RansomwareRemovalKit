Stop CryptoLocker (and copy-cat variants of this badware) before it ruins your day...
This file was last updated 05/14/2015

NOTE: Files referenced in this document are available one level up...
      http://jpelectron.com/sample/Info and Documents/Stop crypto badware before it ruins your day/
      For security reasons you should use your own/random filename for all these files,
      this makes them less susceptible to manipulation by some/future badware.

NOTE: This document was written with Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard in mind,
      but still relevant on other server OS versions

      Body:
User [Source Io Owner]
Saved [Source File Path] to [File Screen Path]

This file is in the [Violated File Group] file group in FSRM, which generated this alert.
A batch was run to remove all server shares until corrective action is taken.

    Event Log tab
      Check "Send warning to event log"
    Command tab
      Check "Run this command or script"
      Browse... C:\Windows\1-PreventCrypto.bat

 ____ Other protections worth doing ____ 

1) Ensure Internet filter is updating to block known badware domains
2) Ensure Internet filter is blocking ccTLDs and IDNs that are not relevant to your business
3) Ensure Firewall is blocking any URLs with an IP address (only the bad guys do this)
4) Ensure Firewall is blocking DNS outbound from everything except your internal/AD DNS server IP(s)
5) Ensure Firewall is allowing only good/necessary ports outbound (NOT any/any)
6) Run CryptoPrevent (by Foolish IT) on every end-user workstation, apply at least the standard rules, restart
7) Consider implementing Software Restriction Policies (SRP) via Group Policy (or AppLocker, or application whitelist)
8) Use an anti-virus product and/or malwarebytes.org on end-user workstations, ensure it is updating

 ____ Cleanup procedure ____ 

 - Either you received an email from FSRM with the details, or you suddenly realized all server shares are missing...
     On the server which detected the bad files go to Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application
     Look for a Warning entry from SRMSVC as the source, the General box contains the details of
     the username and filename which triggered the shares to be removed
 - Unplug the offending user's machine from the network
 - Cleanup user's temp folders and startup items (suggestion: ccleaner.com)
 - Ensure user's machine is malware/toolbar/nonsense free (suggestion: malwarebytes.org)
 - Run CryptoPrevent (by Foolish IT) apply at least the standard rules, restart
 - Format and reload the OS on this user's machine if you prefer
 - Restore any files that did get encrypted from your backups
     NOTE: Many variants of this badware do NOT change the file modified time/date stamp to when encryption occurred
 - Add all the shares back to the server (see created file: C:\Windows\1-PreventCrypto-PreviousShares.txt)
 - Re-enable the Windows firewall rules for File and Printer Sharing
